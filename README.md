# MyReads Project

MyReads project was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

## How to Install App Dependencies and Host The App

This project uses Node.js packages and the Create-React-App starter app.
If you do not have Node.js version 6.x or higher, you can download it from the following link: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the app then run following
commands from the Command Line or Terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/androidpirate/myreads-react-project.git
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch by running the following command from
the Command Line or Terminal:

```
npm start
```

A new browser window should be automatically opened to displaying the app.

If not, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser.

## How to Use the App

- On the Home page, there are three categories of shelves:
  * Currently Reading
  * Want To Read
  * Read
  Once a book is marked as one of those categories, it will show up in one of those shelves.

- It is possible to move a book from one shelf to the other, by simply clicking on the green arrow at
  the bottom of the book cover and simply selecting a shelf from the list.

- You can also remove a book entirely from the shelves by simply selecting 'None' from the list.

- To add new books, click on the + icon at the bottom of the Home page, which will take you to
  Search page, where you can search for keywords. Use the same green arrow icon to add a book to
  one of the shelves.

- Since the API has a limited amount of books, some queries might return no results. In that case,
  try to type in one the following terms into Search bar:
